# RayTracing
My personal ray tracing project, in which I plan to build and employ many interesting visual techniques. 
Just for fun.

All work originally adapted from "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley.
Special thanks to Roger Allen's article which was extremely useful in adaptation to CUDA.
